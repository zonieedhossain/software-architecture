# Cloud Architecture Design for Web Crawler (Public Version)
![CloudDesignDiagram](https://github.com/zonieedhossain/software-architecture/blob/main/graphical-cloud-design-diagram.png)
## 1. Infrastructure Setup

### Kubernetes Cluster on GCP (GKE)

- **Deployment:** Create a Kubernetes cluster in GCP using Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE). This cluster will manage all your crawler instances as pods, allowing you to efficiently scale up or down based on demand.
- **Node Pools:** Configure node pools with appropriate machine types to optimize resource usage and cost. Autoscaling should be enabled to adjust the number of nodes based on the load.

### Containerized Crawlers

- **Containerization:** Package your crawler applications into Docker containers. This encapsulation includes all necessary dependencies, ensuring consistent environments across development, testing, and production.
- **Deployment Configurations:** Define Kubernetes deployments for your crawler applications. Each deployment will manage the lifecycle of the pods, including updates and rollbacks.

## 2. Task Scheduling with CronJobs

- **CronJobs in Kubernetes:** Instead of using individual GCE instances with schedulers, use Kubernetes CronJobs to schedule crawling tasks. CronJobs can trigger crawling processes at scheduled times (e.g., monthly) across multiple websites.
- **Efficiency:** This method reduces overhead by using the cluster's resources only when needed, and pods are terminated after the jobs complete.

## 3. Logging and Monitoring

- **Centralized Logging:** Implement centralized logging using Stackdriver (Google Cloud's operations suite). This captures logs from all pods within the cluster, eliminating the need to check each instance manually.
- **Monitoring:** Set up monitoring with Google Cloud Monitoring to track the performance and health of the Kubernetes cluster and individual pods. Configure alerts for any significant deviations or operational issues.

## 4. Data Management and Processing

- **Event-Driven Architecture:** Use Google Cloud Pub/Sub for handling communication between your crawlers and subsequent processing services.
- **Serverless Processing:** Deploy Google Cloud Functions triggered by Pub/Sub messages to handle data processing tasks post-crawling.
- **Hybrid Data Storage:** Use Google Cloud SQL for structured data and Google Cloud Storage or MongoDB Atlas for unstructured data.

## 5. Security and Compliance

- **Network Security:** Utilize VPC networks and security groups to control traffic to and from the Kubernetes pods.
- **IAM & Roles:** Define IAM roles and policies to enforce minimum privilege access to cloud resources.
- **Data Security:** Implement encryption for data at rest and in transit, and use Google Cloud Armor for additional security enhancements against web and DDoS attacks.

## 6. Scalability and High Availability

- **Load Balancing:** Use Google Cloud Load Balancing to distribute user or system requests across multiple instances of your applications, improving responsiveness and availability.
- **Autoscaling:** Leverage Horizontal Pod Autoscaler in GKE to automatically scale the number of pods based on the observed CPU and memory usage.

## 7. Backup and Disaster Recovery

- **Regular Backups:** Schedule regular backups for your databases and critical data.
- **Disaster Recovery Plan:** Implement strategies for data recovery and system rollback in case of failures.

## 8. Deployment and Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)

- **CI/CD Pipelines:** Set up CI/CD pipelines using Google Cloud Build or other tools like Jenkins. This automates the testing, building, and deployment of your crawler applications to the Kubernetes cluster.
