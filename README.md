# Software Architecture Practice

Welcome to the `software-architecture` repository. This repository hosts the design documents and architectural diagrams for the Generic Web Crawler System. Our goal is to provide a clear and structured approach to understanding and contributing to the development of a scalable and flexible web crawling system.

## Repository Contents

- **Design Document**
- **Cloud Design Diagram**

## Design Document - Crawling System
